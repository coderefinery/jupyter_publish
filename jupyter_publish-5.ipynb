    "# Share and publish your research work\n",
    "\n",
    "To make publication ready scientific reports and presentations, we would need to share our research with [Github](https://github.com/) with an objective to be as reproducible as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will learn how to publish our research work using [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing your GitHub repository along with your jupyter notebooks and your publications is an important step for making your research reproducible. However, anyone willing to rerun your programs/notebooks need to get the same computational environment (python, LaTeX, additional python packages, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section (using [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)) will show you how to make your research “fully” reproducible, offering users the same computational environment as we used during this workshop and with very little extra efforts.\n",

    "\n",
    "We would like to publish all the codes, notebooks, reports, etc. in our repository with Binder. To be Binder-compliant,\n",
    "we need to add configurations files (one or more text files) that specify all the requirements for building your project’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these configuration files are placed in a directory called binder that needs to be in the root directory of your git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check `binder` directory in your repository. We have already prepared all the necessary files for running in Binder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls binder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see 3 files:\n",

    "- apt.txt         \n",
    "- postBuild\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharing our Python environment (environment.yml)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is recommended when all the additional packages/libraries you need are part of conda. Be aware that `conda` is a source package management system and is not only used for `python`. Many packages/libraries, independent of python/R are made available via conda, so the best is to first check online whether your package is already available via conda.\n",
